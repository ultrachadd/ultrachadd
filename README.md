	- Due to it's limitations had to move on to C/C++ and Python and fell in love with them
	- Played around with cryengine when I was 14
	- Wanted to make games, and later, to solve problems
- Built a few Django projects (Backend mostly) but also good at HTML+CSS
- Intermediate Blender3D user, I post my works on sketchfab.com/xtomele
- Experienced Linux user and system/network administrator
	- I'm on team Debian and don't even try..

College CS assignments are always too easy for me, I'm craving some real world experience
Looking forward for any learning / colab opportunities on these subjects :
Would love to get a knowledgeable mentor too.

- Gamedev and Game Engine programming / customization
- Linux supporting FOSS projects
- High performance programming
- Native C / C++ applications
- Graphics programming(GPU)
